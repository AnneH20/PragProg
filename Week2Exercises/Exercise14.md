# Exercise #14

Design an interface to a kitchen blender. It will eventually be a web-based, IoT-enabled blender, but for now we just 
need the interface to control it. It has ten speed settings (0 means off). You canâ€™t operate it empty, and you can 
change the speed only one unit at a time (that is, from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 2, not from 0 to 2).

Here are the methods. Add appropriate pre- and post-conditions and an invariant.
```
int getSpeed()
void setSpeed(int x)
boolean isFull()
void fill()
void empty()
```
