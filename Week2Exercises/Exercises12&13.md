# Exercise #12

Your team initially chose to use **camelCase** names for variables, but then changed their collective mind and switched to

# Exercise #13

Following on from the previous exercise, add the ability to change those variable names automatically in one or more 
files. Remember to keep a backup of the originals in case something goes horribly, horribly wrong.
